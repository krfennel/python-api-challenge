Part 1 Analysis:
The Northern Hemisphere is more effected by temparature than the Southern Hemisphere. 
This is proven by observing the r-values of 0.802 (Northen Hemisphere) and an r-value of 0.394
(Southern Hemisphere).
When reviewing the affects of Humidity although these is less of an effect, there is a slight effect. 
The Northern Hemisphere has an r-value of 0.106 in relation to Humidity and the Southern Hemisphere 
only has a r-value of 0.007.
Cloudiness overall does effect which Hemisphere a city resides however the correlation is so low, 
it's more random.
To acheive a better reading of the effects of Cloudiness, more data would be needed.
